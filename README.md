# Nonlinear counterfactual generation
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks focused on data analysis techniques, including embedding, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and movement along principal curves. These notebooks demonstrate advanced methods for dimensionality reduction, data embedding, and exploring underlying data structures.

## Notebooks

### 1. **Embedding_and_KDE.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: 
     - Demonstrates embedding data into a lower-dimensional space.
     - Applies Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to visualize and analyze the probability density of data in the embedded space.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Implementation of dimensionality reduction techniques.
     - Visualization of data density using KDE.
     - Practical examples of embedding workflows for structured data.

### 2. **Embedding-and-moving-along-principal-curve.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: 
     - Explores data embedding and analyzes the trajectory of data along principal curves.
     - Provides a method to uncover the underlying structure in high-dimensional data.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Principal curve fitting and visualization.
     - Insights into data patterns by moving along these curves.
     - Useful for exploring trends and clusters in complex datasets.
